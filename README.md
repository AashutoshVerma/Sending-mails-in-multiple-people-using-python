# Sending-mails-in-multiple-people-using-python


This is a Python-Script which does your job of sending mails to multiple people at once. 

To run the script there are few pre-requisite steps that are needed to be followed:

Step 1:
  Enable your "less secure app access" functionality from your email account which you will use to send the mails. 
  here's the link to enable it. This is the critical step, without this you won't be able to execute the task.

  note: do not worry, enabling this functionality won't trouble you as it allows other mediums as python SMTP protocol to send mail, nothing else :)
  
Step 2:
  Add a excel file in the same folder where the script resides and changes its extention to ".xls"(if it is .xlsx).
  If you want to send the image/pdf as attachment then add it too to the same folder as the script.
  Add the html template in to the folder if you want your mail to be html-formatted. 
  
  
Step 3:
  Just run the script!!!! its ready to deliver your mails:)
